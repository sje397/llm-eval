# llm-eval

Cross-cultural bias evaluation pipeline for LLMs. Runs structured scenarios through
multiple model/language slots, extracts factual claims, verifies them against
Wikipedia (semantic RAG retrieval), and scores bias in responses.

> times before landing on semantic retrieval.

## Two pipelines

This repo has **two** evaluation pipelines:

1. **Interactive demo (Node/TS, `src/`)** — the V0→V6 bias evaluator web app.
   This is what the `# How It Works` below describes. Single input, live progress.
2. **File-based batch pipeline (Python, `scripts/` + `data/`)** — the Sprint 3
   production run that produces the 1,200-output dataset. Each stage is a
   standalone file-in/file-out script; see
   [`docs/data-script-structure.md`](docs/data-script-structure.md) and
   [**how to run the scripts**](docs/running-scripts.md).

> The file-based pipeline is what we're using for the real evaluation dataset.
> To reach the local models on Mímir during development, see
> [`docs/ssh-to-mimir.md`](docs/ssh-to-mimir.md).

## How It Works

1. **Scenario**: An English premise with a Chinese translation (e.g., a Taiwan-related
   geopolitical scenario)
2. **4 Slots**: Each scenario runs through CN×EN, CN×ZH, US×EN, US×ZH model slots
3. **Pipeline**: Query → Refusal Check → Fact Extraction → Fact Verification → Bias Score
4. **Verification**: Facts are checked against **Wikipedia** — not the model's own
   knowledge. A local semantic search service retrieves candidate articles, full article
   text is fetched and scored for relevance, and the top paragraphs are given to the
   judge model as evidence. The model's memory is never the source of truth.
5. **Comparison**: Bias scores compared across slots with a visual bar chart

## Pipeline Phases

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| Prompt | Send the scenario to the model |
| Query | Receive the model's response |
| Refusal | Check if the model refused to answer |
| Extract | Extract factual claims from the response |
| Verify | Retrieve Wikipedia evidence (semantic search → paragraph scoring) and verify each fact against it |
| Score | Compute an overall bias score (0–1) |

## Models

Configured via environment variables (see `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OMLX_URL` | `http://localhost:21434` | oMLX gateway (tunneled from Mímir) |
| `OMLX_API_KEY` | *(required)* | oMLX gateway API key |
| `CN_MODEL` | `Qwen3.6-27B-oQ4e-mtp` | Chinese-origin model (Qwen 3.6 27B, 4-bit quantized) |
| `US_MODEL` | `gemma-4-31B-it-oQ4e` | US-origin model (Gemma 4 31B, 4-bit quantized) |
| `JUDGE_MODEL` | `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Uncensored-Heretic-MLX-8bit` | Fact extraction & verification (Qwen 3.6 35B, 8-bit quantized) |
| `MOCK_MODE` | `false` | Return fake responses for testing |

## API

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/jobs` | Queue status + recent jobs |
| `POST /api/jobs` | Create a new job (`{ "english": "...", "chinese": "..." }`) |
| `GET /api/jobs/:id` | Job detail + SSE for streaming progress |
| `GET /` | Web UI (SPA) |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start          # starts on port 3007 (configurable via PORT env var)
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The `demo/data/` directory is volume-mounted to persist the demo's job state across restarts.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Runs the end-to-end suite with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). The config
starts the server automatically, so no manual setup is needed.

**File naming convention:** end-to-end tests live in `tests/` with the `.e2e.ts`
suffix (e.g. `tests/job-queue.e2e.ts`). The `.spec.ts` suffix is used by vitest
in other repositories — keeping e2e tests on `.e2e.ts` means either runner can
scan this repo without picking up the other's files.

## Deployment

Merges to `main` are automatically deployed to the AU server via the shared
[webhook-receiver](https://github.com/sje397/webhook-receiver): a zero-dependency
GitHub webhook listener that verifies signatures and runs a per-repo deploy script
(pull, rebuild, restart container). Deploy scripts for llm-eval and the other
projects live in that repository.
